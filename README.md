# Titanic-Data-Science-Project
A project using machine learning classifiers for predictive modeling.

This is a project I've been working on on the data science platform 
'Kaggle'. It makes use of Python libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, and
Sklearn.

Several projects were particularly important for reference in learning 
such as:
